    "An example (Quoting Paul Ohm):\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1990s, an insurance company released 'anonymised' health data on all state employees in Massachusetts. The Governor, said that GIC had protected patient privacy by deleting identifiers. Latanya Sweeney (a postgrad researcher) showed otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "How it was done:\n",
    " - She knew that Governor Weld resided in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a city of 54,000 residents and seven ZIP codes.\n",
    " - For twenty dollars, she purchased the complete voter rolls from the city of Cambridge, a database containing, among other things, the name, address, ZIP code, birth date, and sex of every voter.\n",
    " - By combining this data with the GIC records, Sweeney found Governor Weld with ease.\n",
    "   - Only six people in Cambridge shared his birth date\n",
    "   - Only three of them men\n",
    "   - Of them, only he lived in his ZIP code.\n",
    "   \n",
    "In a theatrical flourish, Dr. Sweeney sent the Governor’s health records (which included diagnoses and prescriptions) to his office[1]\n",

    "\n",
    "> differential privacy: \"maximize the accuracy of queries from statistical databases while minimizing the chances of identifying its records.\" (wikipedia)\n",
    "\n",
    "> differential privacy: \"a promise by a curator to a data subject that they will not be affected by being included, regardless what other sources of data are available\" (privacy book, The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy - Cynthia Dwork & Aaron Roth).\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings in the idea of a \"linkage attack\", combining data sources to infer details about individuals in an \"anonymised\" dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Dwork & Roth again:\n",
    "> \"[DP]... ensures that any [output] is “essentially” equally likely to occur, independent of the presence or absence of any\n",
    "individual. The term “essentially” is captured by a parameter, $\\varepsilon$. A smaller $\\varepsilon$ will yield better privacy (and less accurate responses).\n",
    "\n",
    "And a list of hints/rules-of-thumb (again from Dwork & Roth, actually most of this document is based on their book or wikipedia, which is also based on their book. Maybe just go read the book!).\n",
    "\n",
    " - Data cannot be fully anonymised and remain useful.\n",
    " - Reidentification of anonymised records is not the only risk.\n",
    " - Queries over large sets are not protective.\n",
    " - Query auditing is problematic (e.g. refusing a query could be disclosive, computationally infeasible).\n",
    " - Summary statistics are not safe.\n",
    " - \"Ordinary facts\" are not ok (e.g. shopping habits - give clues around health, household, religion, etc).\n",
    " - Cancel privacy for \"just a few\" people, for \"greater good\" (outliers, etc): A possible moral standpoint, but which is usually (reasonably) rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "A widely used example of Differential Privacy (before it was called that), is the coin-flip example. Participants being asked if they take part in illegal or socially-unacceptable behaviour will often lie. Sociologists have avoided this problem by asking people to flip a coin: If tails they should report the truth, but if heads, the participant must flip again and report yes if heads, no if tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](files/images/diff_priv_coin_small.png \"Coin Flip\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively provides 'plausible deniability'.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Any nontrivial privacy guarantee that holds, regardless of all present and future sources of auxiliary information requires RANDOMISATION***\n",
    "\n",
    "###A simple example\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the wikipedia example, and extending/explaining it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a database, such as this one:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Name    Has Diabetes\n",
    "    0 Adam         0\n",
    "    1 Beth         1\n",
    "    2 Charlie      1\n",
    "    3 Diane        0\n",
    "    4 Elizabeth    0\n",
    "    5 Fred         1 (new person)\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to provide a summary statistic (such as the sum number of people with diabetes: Maybe to know how many drugs to stock).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a new person is added to the database, we could query it again. Unfortunately by subtracting the two values we could find his diabetes-state, even though the query result itself doesn't mention names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential Privacy aims to avoid that. Before releasing the summary value, one must apply a function to the value to provide this privacy. This is usually a matter of adding a random value. For this example, if we are first asked for the sum (without Fred), we take the actual sum (2) and add/subtract a value (e.g. +1.6): Giving 3.6 as the sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "When Fred is added and someone asked for the sum, we do the same: Take the actual sum (3) and add/subtract a random value (e.g. +0.9), giving 3.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adversary, who asked these two queries can't be sure whether Fred has diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "###More formal definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Slightly more formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a randomisation algorithm $M$. It is $\\varepsilon$-private if the following holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the outputs $M(D_1)$ and $M(D_2)$ provided to the adversary, from the database with ($D_1$) and without ($D_2$) Fred, we can compare the probability of any given value output $P[M(D_1)]$ and $P[M(D_2)]$. We want the probabilities of these two outputs to be very similar, such that, for any value of M:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P[M(D_1)] \\leq e^{\\varepsilon} P[M(D_2)] + \\delta$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Often the two databases are defined by their $L_1$ norm, such that: $||D_1 - D_2|| \\leq 1$. Where ||D|| is the sum over the number of elements of each type. Basically the length of the database (?). **TBC**\n",
    "\n",
    "####Delta: $\\delta$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\delta=0$ we say that the algorithm is $\\varepsilon$-differentially private.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,...? TODO...\n",
    "\n",
    "###Coin flip example continued...\n",
    "\n",
    "From http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859m-s11/www/lectures/lect0420.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possibly clearer to write the above inequality as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$e^{-\\varepsilon} \\leq {{P[M(X)=v]} \\over {P[M(X')=v]}} \\leq e^{\\varepsilon}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ and $X'$ are the two databases, with one row changed, where the change is the one with the largest possible effective on the value of $M(X)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coin flip above, the probability of an outcome (e.g. a Yes) given the underlying 'database'/actual value is 'True', is ${}^3/_4$. Similarly the probability of the same outcome given the most different underlying actual value (False) is, ${}^1/_4$. Substituting into the above equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$e^{-\\varepsilon} \\leq {{3/4} \\over {1/4}} \\leq e^{\\varepsilon}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$3 = e^{\\varepsilon}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\varepsilon = ln(3)$\n",
