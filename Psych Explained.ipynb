    "###Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Online Psychic is a website, integrated as a facebook app, which asks a series of questions and then, using various sources of data, infers facts about the user (currently their age, gender and religion).\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a general framework for:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Selecting questions\n",
    " - Creating question text\n",
    " - Recording answers\n",
    " - Incorporating new datasets\n",
    " - Calculating conditional probabilities, i.e. p(age|gender, postcode, religion)\n",
    " - Performing inference on these conditional probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we define a base class Answer. This has the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    " - question_to_text - produce a string with text of question (in future might want to make it more interactive, like TypeForm as suggested by Enoch).\n",
    " - get_pymc_function - generate the categorical conditional probability distribution used by pyMC\n",
    " - append_facts - add facts to the 'facts' dictionary. These are true things (e.g. the person's name), that we don't do probabilistic inference on directly, but instead are used by other modules.\n",
    " - append_features - these are pymc nodes in the bayesian network\n",
    " - pick_question - this returns the question that the module would like to ask (in the future maybe pass what we would like to have an answer to, and also a way of returning how much information that question will provide, so we can select the most appropriate question from among different classes).\n",
    " - process_answer - occasionally used to reformat or adjust the answer given by the user before putting it in the database. Useful if it requires computation/API queries to avoid this being required repeatedly when the DB is read.\n",
    " \n",
    "This class is inherited by each dataset (census, movielens, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "When an answer is returned, it is added to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding selection of questions; currently a random class is selected. The long term plan: When a question needs asking, each class is asked, given a feature we want to know, for a question and an estimate of how much information that question will provide towards that feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "####Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "Supposing, gender is not known, but it would be very useful for movielens' guess. We can get an improved estimate of gender from the census. How do we automatically ask the census class for an estimate of gender? As the design gets more complicated these dependencies become more intricate. We know which of 10 films the user has seen; combining the data from these will also probably be more effective than assuming independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible ways to deal with this are to either use an undirected graph (the census info provides data to the movie lens and vice versa) or ideally, ensure directed graph is acyclic, by careful graph design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than write a new Bayesian inference engine ourselves, there are python libraries that will do this for us: BayesPy, pyMC, libpgm, scikit-learn (only does naive bayes?). I chose pyMC as the most usable/practical/well-documented.\n",

    "The table of greatest importance is the 'qa' (question-answer) table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE qa (userid integer, dataset varchar(255), dataitem varchar(255), detail varchar(255), answered integer, asked_last integer, answer varchar(255), PRIMARY KEY (userid, dataset, dataitem, detail));\n",

    "###Designing the Bayesian Network\n",
    "\n",
    "So far things seem to have worked ok, however: A key problem with this model becomes apparent when we try to add more images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initially imagined a network such as:\n",
    "![alt text](files/images/bayes_1.png \"Bayesian Network\")\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if we wanted to add an additionally source of data, say, the number of cats on the person's facebook page.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](files/images/bayes2.png \"Network with an additional data source\")\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have two, very difficult probability distributions to create. Of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(age|postcode, facebook_{cats})$\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this we need to be more careful about the order and design of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "A principled approach would have causes: Age, Gender, Religion, Height, Political-position, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "and would have effects or observations: Facebook cat count, Movie Preferences, Music preferences, postcode, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "We then ensure that the network is of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](files/images/bayes3.png \"Restricted network\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically a form of factor analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can allow some connections between observations, but need to be careful to avoid loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](files/images/bayes4.png \"Less Restricted network\")\n",
    "\n",
    "One could have nodes on the bottom layer that are only connected to other bottom-layer nodes, causing a hierarchical model, with the dangers and problems mentioned (1. inability of the current system to handle conditionals $P(factor|list\\;of\\; observations)$, 2. loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "To enforce this general structure, there are some choices:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Have two feature vectors, one for factors and one for outcomes.\n",
    " - Have a flag associated with a feature to mark it as a factor.\n",
    " - Just being careful in defining the conditional probability distributions.\n",
    " \n",
    "I quite like the simplicity of a single list.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Facts\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle 'facts', even if these are 'facts' about probabilities, a new dictionary, called 'facts' has been created.
